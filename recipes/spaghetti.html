    <h3>How to Make Spaghetti</h3>
    <p>
      It seems like everyone I have ever met has “a spaghetti recipe” they know
      and love, and each one is different! Some have store-bought sauce, some
      homemade. Some have meat, some have veggies, and others do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is simple, easy to make, always tastes delicious, and everyone likes
      it. And honestly, leftovers taste exactly the same heated up as if it was
      just made (my kind of leftover)

    <ul>
      <li>Ground Beef</li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Brown the ground beef</li>
      <li>Boil the pasta</li>
      <li>Warm the sauce</li>
      <li>Add altogether</li>
